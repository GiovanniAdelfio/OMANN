# OMANN: Orthogonal Matrices Alignment for Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project aims to extend the GIT Re-Basin framework for Neural Networks alignment from permutation matrices to generic orthogonal matrices, using the Procrustes method. 
* **Course:** Machine Learning (Grade: 30L/30) 
* **Language:** Python


The results are displayed in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mR_kNssSrOKpJYGkvvAFrs5DftXmeAaz?usp=sharing).

A concise and theoretical explaination is available in and in ![OMANN]("OMANN.PDF"). 


Partial credits for the original [Git Re_Basin](https://github.com/samuela/git-re-basin) implementetion to [themrzmaster](https://github.com/themrzmaster).

The repository contains also, in RESNET, files created in a failed attempt to implement PWM on Resnet20 (1x), trained on Cifar10.

Note : the data and tests displayed on the Colab were run locally due to gpu limitations, re-running them on Colab might results in minor incompabilities.
